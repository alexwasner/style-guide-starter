##Style Guide Starter

###Getting Started
1. After downloading the source, you will need to get all of the required packages to run the local server. 
	- Run `npm install` (For more information on npm, see [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/))
2. After install completes, you can run `gulp watch` to start the live-reload server. If a browser did not open, you can go to `localhost:8081` to view the base page.
